Here is the core functionality I want to implement:
- Users can CRUD lists to hold tasks they can CRUD.
- Tasks are time bound, the length is measured in pomodoros, 25 minute blocks with 5 minute breaks.
- Tasks can be marked complete/uncomplete
- Tasks can be flagged to be included in a separate "today's tasks" list. 
- Tasks from "today's tasks" can be started by running the pomodoro timer.
- Pomodoro timer counts down from 25 minutes. Immediately counts down from 5 minutes afterwards.
- Pomodoro is automatically marked complete if both timers finish.
- Pomodoro is automatically marked incomplete if the timers are stopped before finishing.
- During a running Pomodoro timer, Users can log a new task to be done later. this task is automatically added to the "unplanned tasks" list
- Users can see the number of completed/uncompleted tasks and completed/uncompleted pomodoros for each list.
- User can see the above for the whole day
